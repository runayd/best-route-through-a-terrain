# BestRouteThroughTerrain

When in college, one of things that a student is expected to have are personal projects. So that the students have a way to materialize the knowledge gained and exhibit the skills they acquired. Even though I am not in college now, I am still a student. Even though I am working as a software engineer now,I still have a lot to learn. Thus, to keep learning, I decided to work on a personal project around my current domain of web development.

The purpose of a personal project is not necessarily to tackle any world problem but to keep harboring the desire of doing something like that someday. So, instead of dawdling, thinking of some complex problem statement, I decided to keep it simple. I wanted a project where I can make mistakes, learn lessons, and explore web development with no commitment to others but myself.

While I was thinking of that 'easy-peasy' idea, I came across Cl√©ment Mihailescu's pathfinding project. Instantly, it seemed like a fun and appealing concept to try. But I wanted to make it a little more challenging, enough to not rely on his code when I come across any hiccups while completing the project. Around the same time I came across this LeetCode problem '61. Minimum Path Sum' which ended up giving me the idea that shaped my version of a path finding application, concluding my search for a problem statement.

The biggest challenge when doing a personal project is there is no obligation for you to complete it. So the only way I could get through this was to develop discipline, practice patience and focus on the joy I get from exploring ideas that intrigue me. And while doing this, I learned more things to avoid than the things I needed to do.

Thank you for reading. Have a great day!
